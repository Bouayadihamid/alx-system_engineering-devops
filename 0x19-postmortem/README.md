Postmortem: Etsy Global Outage Due to Misconfigured Multicast Traffic

< Incident Summary: >
On May 12, 2024, Etsy experienced a widespread outage that affected its global services. The root cause was identified as misconfigured multicast traffic, which led to disruptions across various systems and services. The incident resulted in significant downtime and impacted user experience for Etsy's customers worldwide.

< Timeline of Events: >

May 12, 2024, 10:00 AM: Etsy's network team made configuration changes to enable multicast traffic for specific purposes.
May 12, 2024, 10:30 AM: Unintentionally, the multicast traffic was sent without proper configuration of switches, causing unexpected behavior within the network.
May 12, 2024, 11:00 AM: Reports of service degradation and downtime began to surface as the multicast traffic overwhelmed network resources.
May 12, 2024, 11:30 AM: Etsy's engineering and operations teams were alerted to the issue and initiated investigations to identify the root cause.
May 12, 2024, 12:00 PM: As the impact became evident, Etsy's incident response team declared a full-scale outage and began implementing mitigation measures.
May 12, 2024, 1:00 PM: After extensive troubleshooting, the misconfigured multicast traffic was identified as the primary cause of the outage.
May 12, 2024, 2:00 PM: Etsy's teams worked diligently to rectify the issue by reverting the configuration changes and restoring normal network operations.
May 12, 2024, 4:00 PM: Services gradually resumed functionality, and Etsy communicated updates and apologies to its users via various channels.
Root Cause Analysis:
The root cause of the outage was determined to be misconfigured multicast traffic. The multicast traffic, intended for specific purposes within the network, was sent without proper configuration of switches. This led to a cascading effect, overwhelming network resources and causing widespread disruptions across Etsy's global infrastructure.

< Contributing Factors: >
Several factors contributed to the incident:

Inadequate testing: The changes to enable multicast traffic were not adequately tested in a controlled environment before being deployed in the production environment.
Lack of configuration validation: There was a failure to validate the configuration changes on switches, leading to unintended consequences.
Monitoring and alerting deficiencies: Initial signs of the issue may not have been promptly detected due to inadequate monitoring and alerting systems.
Communication gaps: There may have been communication gaps between teams involved in making and implementing network configuration changes, leading to misalignment of objectives.
< Mitigation and Preventive Measures: >
To prevent similar incidents in the future, Etsy will undertake the following measures:

Enhanced testing procedures: Implement rigorous testing procedures for network configuration changes in staging environments before deployment to production.
Configuration validation: Develop automated tools or processes to validate network configurations before implementation.
Improved monitoring and alerting: Enhance monitoring systems to promptly detect and alert on abnormal network behavior, enabling rapid response to incidents.
Communication and collaboration: Foster better communication and collaboration between teams involved in network operations to ensure alignment of objectives and prevent misconfigurations.
< Conclusion: >
The Etsy global outage caused by misconfigured multicast traffic highlighted the importance of robust testing, configuration validation, monitoring, and communication in maintaining the reliability and resilience of network infrastructure. By implementing the identified mitigation and preventive measures, Etsy aims to strengthen its network resilience and minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future.
